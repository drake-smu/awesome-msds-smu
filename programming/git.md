## Topics  

### gitignore  
- [A collection of .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

### submodules 
**Attention:** while compiling these resources, and while managing a number nesting 
of nested projects recently, there is a case to be made for [subtrees](https://tsh.io/blog/git-subtree-or-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-external-dependencies/) as the simpler/appropriate solution for

### subtrees  

Subtrees are lighterweight than submodules and can be maintained in without 
needing to actively manage two repos separately.
